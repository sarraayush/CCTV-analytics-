# CCTV-analytics
Design and develop a technological solution based on live CCTV feeds, that can automatically detect incidents related to street crime, violence, burglary, theft, infiltration, unauthorized access etc. and generate alerts to the nearest Police Station. The solution should also be able to generate a report and maintain a database that includes the nature of incident/crime, location, time, level of alert (i.e., low, medium, high risk alert) etc.
